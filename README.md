# modern_cryptography
Encoding and decoding data types that are commonly used in cryptography.

**Encoding**
- [x] ASCII 
- [x] Hex 
- [x] Base64 
- [x] Bytes and Big Integers 
- [x] Encoding Automation (Using the [pwntools library](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) (pwn)) --please note that the [Pwntools library](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html#installation) is best supported on 64-bit Ubuntu LTS releases (14.04, 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04). Most functionality should work on any Posix-like distribution (Debian, Arch, FreeBSD, OSX, etc.). **It's not compatible with Windows!**

    

**XOR**
- [x] XOR Starter 
- [ ] XOR Properties 
- [ ] Lemur XOR

**Mathematics**
- [x] Greatest Common Divisor - Euclidean Algorithm

``` 
Step 1:  Let  a, b  be the two numbers
Step 2:  a mod b = R
Step 3:  Let  a = b  and  b = R
Step 4:  Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until  a mod b  is greater than 0
Step 5:  GCD = b
Step 6: Finish
